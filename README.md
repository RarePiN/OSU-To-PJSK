# OSU-To-PJSK
This is a simple C++ code that is to convert osu mania map files into Sonolus(PJSK Clone) charts.
Only the mapping is converted, the audio, song cover image (jacket) and the song info are not carried.

# WIP / (Known issues)
Now any key count is supported.
However bpm changes and scroll speed changes are still unavailable.
