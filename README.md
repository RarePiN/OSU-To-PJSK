# OSU-To-PJSK
This is a simple C++ code that is to convert osu mania map files into Sonolus(PJSK Clone) charts.
Only the mapping is converted, the audio, song cover image (jacket) and the song info are not carried.

# WIP / (Known issues)
Only OSU Mania 4k charts are supported at the moment.
8th Notes and so on are misaligned with the original chart.
Currently bpm and scroll speed changes cannot be converted (The notes timing isnt affected)
Some OSU Mania charts cannot be converted due to unknown reasons.
